# Robust-Median-Filtering-Detection
It involves the complete implementation of research paper on Robust Median Filtering based on Local Difference Descriptor with code

### The requirement for the project are:

Numpy (1.19.2)

cv2 (4.5.1)

matplotlib (3.3.2)

threading (3.9.1)

scikit-learn (0.24.1)

pickle (4.0)

pandas (1.2.1)

Ensure that the UCID Dataset is provided for generation of the mean/median filtered dataset and running of code.

## Running the code

We have submitted a single IPYNB file containing all the code for the project. The code is well commented and can be run in a sequential manner.

You just need to run the cells in the notebook in a sequential manner and the code will run.

The code can be run on Visual Studio Code or Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab or any other platform that supports IPYNB files as per your convenience.
